###Background 
I graduated from PNU university with a bachelor of science in Aerospace engineering.I have worked at some of the top firms in the industry as a web developer,but I have found new passion in data science and cryptocurrency.
I started coding more often in order to improve my skills.I enjoyed automating tasks we commenly complete manually.
I started working on predictive analytics projects on my own even though I wasn't assigned any.I came up with my own ideas designed a solution and started implementing them proactively.
